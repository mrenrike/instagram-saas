# Cold Email Copywriting

## Overview

Cold email copy that converts is not about being clever. It is about being
relevant. The prospect asks two questions in the first two seconds: "Do I
know this person?" and "Is this relevant to me?" If the answer to either is
no, the email is deleted — regardless of how well the rest is written.

This skill applies proven copywriting frameworks — PAS, BAB, AIDA, SPARK,
and the 3-line cold email framework — to produce emails that pass the
two-second test. It covers subject line construction, personalization tiers,
persona-specific voice variants, and the psychological triggers that drive
replies. It draws from Cialdini's principles of influence, Schwartz's
awareness levels, Ogilvy's advertising discipline, and Josh Braun's
problem-first approach.

The skill produces: complete email copy for each touch in a sequence, with
subject lines, body text, and CTAs. Includes variants by persona seniority
(VP, Director, Manager, IC) and by personalization tier (T1 merge, T2 segment,
T3 per-lead). When given a sequence map from `cold-email-strategy`, it writes
the copy for every touch. When given a single touch, it writes a single email.

The non-obvious rule: the best cold email is one that would work if you sent
it to a colleague. It sounds human, it references something specific, it asks
a low-friction question, and it never opens with "My name is X and I work at Y."

## When to Use

- User says "write a cold email" or "draft outreach to [persona]" →
  activate this skill
- User says "improve my cold email" or "make this email better" →
  activate this skill
- User asks for "subject line ideas" or "subject line that gets opens" →
  activate this skill
- User mentions "personalize this email," "make this T3," or

Do NOT use for:
- Designing the sequence architecture → use `cold-email-strategy`
- Writing LinkedIn messages or call scripts → use `multi-channel-outreach`
- Classifying or writing auto-responses to replies → use `reply-handling`
- Deliverability concerns (SPF, DKIM, warmup) → use `email-deliverability`

## Authoritative Foundations

This skill draws from the following established methodologies:

- **Cialdini — Principles of Influence** — Six principles applied to email copy:
  Reciprocity (Touch 4 gives value before asking), Social Proof (Touch 3
  uses customer proof), Authority (credible data points), Liking (human voice,
  not corporate), Scarcity (Touch 6 reframe creates FOMO), Commitment (small
  CTA in Touch 1 builds toward larger ask). The first touch should use at
  least one principle; the full sequence should use all six.

- **Eugene Schwartz — Breakthrough Advertising** — Five levels of prospect
  awareness. Cold email must match the prospect's awareness level. Tier 1:
  Unaware (don't know they have a problem — email opens with problem
  education). Tier 2: Problem-Aware (know they have a problem but not your
  solution — email opens with solution differentiation). Most cold email
  fails by writing for Tier 3-5 prospects who are already solution-aware,
  when the actual prospect is at Tier 1 or 2.

- **David Ogilvy — Ogilvy on Advertising** — "The headline is 80 cents of
  your dollar." In cold email, the subject line is the headline. It must
  earn the open. Principles: specificity over generality, curiosity over
  clarity, lowercase over title case, brevity over completeness. 2-4 words
  is the optimal range.

- **Josh Braun — Problem-First Selling** — "You can't sell to someone who
  doesn't know they have a problem." The first email must open with a
  problem hypothesis, not a solution pitch. If the prospect doesn't
  acknowledge the problem, no amount of solution detail matters. The
  fundamental question: "What problem am I helping the prospect discover?"

- **Becc Holland — Stellar Cold Email.** Seven Pillars: relevance to metrics,
  problems, triggers, unknowns; psychological safety; structure; sequence logic.
  Five questions: get/open/read/relevance/care. Canonical structure guide →
  `../cold-email-strategy/references/becc-holland-playbook.md`.

- **Guillaume Moubeche — lemlist copy structure.** Subject (2–3 words) →
  personalized intro → Situation/Problem → Value → Social proof → **CTC**
  (Call to Conversation). Problem before product — always.

- **Jordan Crawford — PVP copy.** Message must pass pay-to-receive test: lead
  with data-combined insight about *their* pain; defer product. See
  `../cold-email-strategy/references/jordan-crawford-blueprint-gtm.md`.

- **Joanna Wiebe (Copyhackers)** — Conversion copy principles. "Start with
  the conversation happening in the prospect's head." The opening line must
  match the internal monologue the prospect is already having. Write from
  "you" perspective — the prospect should feel seen, not sold to.

- **ColdIQ — 3-Line Framework and SPARK** — The highest-performing cold email
  format (2024-2026) is 3 lines: Observation → Relevance → CTA. Under 80 words
  total. No paragraphs. SPARK framework for trigger-based openings: Signal →
  Problem → Answer → Result → Key takeaway.

- **Justin Michael — *Tech-Powered Sales* (REPLY + Sales Borg Action)** — Copy
  rules from Part II: **REPLY** = Relevant results · Empathy · Personalization ·
  Laser-focus. Lead with persona opportunity, not your product. Subject lines:
  1–3 words (action words like "growth"); body 3–5 sentences with CTA often as
  the third line. **Relevant personalization** beats vanity demographics — tie
  opens to pain/trigger, not "I saw your college." Make them the hero; avoid
  you-oriented buyer copy. Canonical playbook → `cold-email-strategy` →
  `justin-michael-sales-borg.md`.

- **Pat Spielmann — Hook, Line, & Sinker (LeadMagic / Cold to Gold)** — Primary
  copy skeleton for enrichment-powered outbound: **Hook** = micro-niched problem
  question · **Line** = agitate + proof of pattern · **Sinker** = no-brainer offer
  or service lead magnet · **CTA** = micro-commitment. Pair with verified
  enrichment data for the hook — not fake AI personalization. Full playbook →
  `references/pat-spielmann-outbound-copy.md`. Use when writing offer-heavy touch
  1 or auditing AI-generated copy before scale.

- **Eric Nowoslawski — Creative Ideas & Pay-for-Discovery Offers (Growth Engine X).**
  Default campaign for new programs: **3 constrained ideas** per prospect (each
  maps to a real capability) — not AI slop compliments. **AI Specificity** variant:
  one idea in body + second in P.S. Offers must pass "would they pay for the
  discovery call?" and answer why someone wouldn't respond. Crawl phase: write
  5–10 emails manually before automating. Pairs with Pat (data quality) and Jordan
  (segment depth) — Eric adds offer format + scale QA. Playbook →
  `../cold-email-strategy/references/eric-nowoslawski-outbound.md`.

- **Leslie Venetz — Problem-Centric Copy Audit (Sales-Led GTM).** A deterministic
  buyer-first edit: count **"I / we / our"** vs **"you / yours / they / them"** and
  push toward a **~1:3 ratio** (talk about the buyer ~3x for every 1x about
  yourself); cut self-centered openers ("we sell / our company / I noticed"). Before
  hitting send, apply the **"Earn the Right"** gate — has this email said something
  relevant/valuable enough to justify the ask? A great cold email is clear, concise,
  and centered on the buyer, not long or clever. Pairs with Pat's Hook-Line-Sinker
  (structure) and Josh Braun (problem-first). Playbook →
  `../cold-email-strategy/references/leslie-venetz-buyer-first-outbound.md`.

## Prerequisites

- Run `cold-email-strategy` first — the copy fills the architecture, not
  the other way around. You need the sequence map (touch goals, channel
  assignments, word counts) before writing copy.
- Run `positioning-messaging` if available — you need clear value props
  and differentiation to weave into social proof and reframe touches.
- Required inputs: target persona (title, industry, pain points), sequence
  map from `cold-email-strategy` (or at minimum the touch goals)
- Optional: `gtm-context` for company ICP and voice guidelines
- Reference files: `references/email-frameworks.md` for framework details
  and sequence structure rules

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Intake

Gather the following from the user. Ask all questions at once:

1. **What are we writing?** Full sequence (all touches) or single email?
   If single, which touch number and goal?

2. **Target persona:** Title, industry, company stage/size, known pain points.

3. **Sequence map:** From `cold-email-strategy`. Need at minimum: touch goals,
   word count limits, emotional targets per touch.

4. **Personalization tier:** T1 (merge fields only), T2 (segment-specific
   templates), or T3 (deep per-lead, signal-anchored opening)? This determines
   how we write the opening line.

5. **Trigger signal (if T3):** What specific signal are we anchoring to?
   "Noticed you recently [funding round, job change, hiring surge, product
   launch, conference talk, article, podcast]."

6. **Voice guidelines:** Does the company have a brand voice? If not: casual
   and confident is the default. Sharp, thoughtful human — not a sales machine.

7. **Frameworks to use:** PAS, BAB, AIDA, SPARK, or 3-line? Default: Touch 1
   uses SPARK/3-line, Touch 2 uses BAB, Touch 3 uses AIDA, Touch 5 uses PAS.

8. **Previous emails (for critique):** If user is asking to improve existing
   copy, paste the current version.

### Phase 2: Research

For each touch being written, gather the anchoring context:

1. **Pain point validation:** For this persona in this industry, what are
   the 3-5 most acute pain points right now? Use industry reports, G2
   reviews, Reddit communities, LinkedIn discussions to confirm. Don't
   guess — find real language prospects use.

2. **Proof point sourcing:** What specific, named examples can we use?
   "One [industry] company reduced [metric] by [X]% in [timeframe]."
   If possible, name the company. If not, use enough specificity to be
   credible: "A Series B fintech company with ~200 employees..."

3. **Objection mining:** What are the top 3 objections this persona has?
   Source from: competitor G2 reviews (what do they complain about?),
   LinkedIn comments on industry posts, Reddit, sales call recordings.
   These become the material for Touch 5 (objection pre-handle).

4. **Competitor copy audit:** What are 3-5 competitors sending to this same
   persona? What language, frameworks, pain points are they using? Identify
   the gap — what are they NOT saying that creates differentiation space?

### Phase 3: Execution

Write the copy for each touch in the sequence. Follow these rules for every
touch, then apply the touch-specific framework.

#### Universal Rules (Apply to Every Touch)

1. **Subject line:** 2-4 words, lowercase, no punctuation. Looks like it
   came from a colleague. Examples: "reply rates," "hiring ops," "Q2
   forecast," "pipeline question," "your [role] stack," "[company] + [topic]."
   Never: emojis, prospect's first name (signals automation), "Re:" or
   "Fwd:" (dishonest), product names, urgency words.

2. **Opening line:** Never "My name is X and I work at Y." Never "I hope
   this email finds you well." The opening line must earn the next sentence.
   For T3: anchor to a specific signal. For T2: anchor to a shared context.
   For T1: anchor to a universal pain point.

3. **Body:** Plain text only. No HTML, no images, no bold, no italics.
   Single-line breaks between sentences. Under 80 words total for Touch 1
   (longer for later touches when the prospect is warmer). One proof point
   beats ten features.

4. **Voice:** "You/your" should outnumber "I/we" by 3:1. Use contractions.
   Read it aloud — if it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it. Never use:
   "leverage," "synergy," "circle back," "best-in-class," "leading provider,"
   "robust," "innovative," "advanced."

5. **CTA:** Low friction. For Touch 1-2: a question mark ("Worth a
   conversation?" "Seeing the same?" "Open to a thought?"). For Touch 3-4:
   a specific, small ask ("Happy to share the case study if useful."). For
   Touch 5-6: a slightly larger ask ("Would a 15-minute call to share what
   we're seeing make sense?"). Never ask for a 30-minute call in Touch 1.

6. **Signature:** First name only. No title, no company boilerplate, no
   logo, no legal disclaimer, no "Sent from my iPhone."

#### Sequence Touch Library

Use `references/sequence-touch-library.md` for the full seven-touch email library and persona voice variants. In SKILL.md, keep the generated sequence concise and include only the final selected touch structure.

### Phase 4: Delivery

Deliver the copy in the sequence order with clear labeling:

1. **Full sequence:** Every touch with complete subject line + body + signature.
2. **Persona variants (if requested):** At least one variant at a different
   seniority level.
3. **A/B test candidates (if requested):** 2-3 subject line variants per touch,
   2-3 opening line variants per touch.
4. **Copy audit (if requested):** Marked-up version of user's original email
   with specific feedback and rewrite.

## Quality Check

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Touch 1: Does it open with a problem or observation, not a company
  introduction? Under 90 words? Low-friction CTA?
- [ ] Subject lines: 2-4 words? Lowercase? No emojis or prospect name?
  Sounds like a colleague wrote it?
- [ ] Voice: "You/your" outnumbers "I/we" 3:1? Uses contractions? Read
  aloud without sounding like marketing copy?
- [ ] Personalization tier correct: T3 has a specific signal? T2 has
  industry/role context? T1 has merge fields?
- [ ] No banned words: "leverage," "synergy," "circle back," "best-in-class,"
  "leading provider," "robust," "innovative," "advanced"?
- [ ] No HTML, images, bold, italics? Plain text only?
- [ ] CTA appropriate for touch number? (Touch 1-2: question mark, Touch
  3-4: small ask, Touch 5-6: slightly larger ask)
- [ ] Touch 7: Short? Honors the "no"? No guilt or urgency?
- [ ] Every touch: Under word count limit? Distinct emotional goal?
  Advances the narrative arc?
- [ ] Social proof: Named customer or credible industry stat? Not fabricated?
- [ ] Signature: First name only? No boilerplate?

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"My name is X" opening.** The #1 cold email mistake. The prospect
   doesn't care who you are until they know why you're relevant. Lead
   with THEM, not YOU.

2. **Too long.** The optimal cold email is under 80 words. For every 20
   words beyond that, reply rates drop by approximately 20%. If you need
   more space, you're trying to sell in one email — that's what the
   sequence is for.

3. **Feature dumps.** "Our platform offers A, B, C, D, and E with
   industry-leading F." Delete. Replace with one proof point: "One
   customer reduced [pain metric] by [X]%."

4. **Fake familiarity.** "Re:" and "Fwd:" subject lines, overly casual
   openings, pretending to have met. Prospects see through this instantly.
   Professional respect beats fake familiarity every time.

5. **Wrong awareness level.** Most cold email is written for
   solution-aware prospects (Schwartz Tier 3-4), but most prospects are
   problem-aware or unaware (Tier 1-2). If the prospect doesn't know they
   have a problem, leading with your solution is irrelevant.

6. **No CTA.** Every email needs a next step. But the CTA must match the
   relationship stage. Touch 1: a question. Touch 3: "if useful." Touch 6:
   "would a call make sense?"

7. **One-size-fits-all.** A VP of Engineering and a Director of Marketing
   should receive fundamentally different emails. If only the company name
   changes, you're doing Tier 1 when you think you're doing Tier 2.

8. **No A/B testing.** Even great copy degrades. Always deliver at least
   one subject line variant and one opening line variant per touch.

## Subject Line Pattern Library

Use `references/subject-line-patterns.md` when the task needs subject-line pattern selection. Default to 3-5 plain-language options tied to the prospect signal, not clever copy.
